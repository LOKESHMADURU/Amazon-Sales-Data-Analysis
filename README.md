# 📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

## 📝 Project Description
The **Amazon Sales Data Analysis** project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of Amazon’s sales transactions using **SQL**.  
The dataset contains **1,000 transaction records** from **three city branches — Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw**.  

The main goal of this project is to explore **sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends** using structured SQL queries.  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for **data cleaning, transformation, and business insight generation**.

Key highlights:
- Built and structured a **MySQL database** using Amazon sales data.  
- Conducted **data wrangling** to clean and standardize records.  
- Applied **feature engineering** to create new analytical columns (`timeofday`, `dayname`, `monthname`).  
- Executed **28 SQL queries** to answer real-world business questions about product performance, customer segmentation, payment patterns, and revenue growth.  
- Delivered insights on **top-performing branches, profitable product lines, and customer purchase behavior**.

The analysis revealed that:
- The **Yangon branch** generated the highest total revenue.  
- **Health & Beauty** emerged as the best-performing product line.  
- **Female members** were the top contributors to total sales.  

This project showcases the power of SQL for **data-driven decision-making** and **retail sales analysis**.

## ⚙️ Approach & Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Wrangling
- Created a new **MySQL database** (`sql_capstone_project`).  
- Imported data and standardized column names.  
- Removed rows containing null values.  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Added new columns to enrich insights:
- `timeofday` → Morning / Afternoon / Evening  
- `dayname` → Day of the week (Mon–Sun)  
- `monthname` → Month of the year (Jan–Dec)

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Executed **28 SQL queries** to answer business questions related to:
  - Product performance  
  - Branch profitability  
  - Customer type and gender analysis  
  - Time- and day-based sales patterns
